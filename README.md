## 🧩 Problem Description

Many students choose their academic streams and career paths based on limited information, social influence, or outdated guidance. They often lack awareness of current industry demands, required skill sets, and their own competency levels. As a result, students may graduate with degrees that do not align with market needs, leading to skill mismatch, unemployment, or underemployment. This gap between education choices and real-world expectations creates frustration for students and inefficiency in the workforce.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is structured as a simple, modular web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase. The front end consists of separate pages for login, user details, home, category selection, career options, and syllabus display, each designed to guide the user step by step. HTML handles the page structure, CSS is used for consistent styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript manages page navigation, user interactions, and data flow. Firebase Authentication is used for secure user login, while Firebase Firestore stores user details and related data in the cloud. The logic is kept beginner-friendly by using minimal JavaScript files with clear functions, and all pages are connected through controlled redirects to ensure only authenticated users can access the main features of the website.
