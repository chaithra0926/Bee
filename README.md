## 🧩 Problem Description

Many students choose their academic streams and career paths based on limited information, social influence, or outdated guidance. They often lack awareness of current industry demands, required skill sets, and their own competency levels. As a result, students may graduate with degrees that do not align with market needs, leading to skill mismatch, unemployment, or underemployment. This gap between education choices and real-world expectations creates frustration for students and inefficiency in the workforce.
